# macroSearch
A foundry module that hookes into game.macros.getName() and searches compendiums for macros.

I created this mainly to find and run macros that I had stored in a shared compendium. To avoid creating duplicates, and loading a bunch of macros into the game.macros.

In the settings menu for macro search there is an exclude and include selection. All compendiums are included by default. But you can move compendiums to the exclude from search to speed things up and improve performance. Or to avoid finding duplicate macros.
